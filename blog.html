        <p>New York is mine. My first kiss, my home, my escape from home, my heart, my heartbreaker. She's mine. And yes, New York is a woman. Obviously.</p>

        <p>As is the case in most tumultuous relationships, New York is the source of my best stories. Like that time I brought a boy to my NYU college dorm and the security guard - who had gotten to know me and my romantic conquests - gave me a discerning look suggesting I should really let this one go. Or that time (ok, more than once) that I ordered Domino’s to my apartment in an exceptionally drunken state and fell asleep before it arrived, leading to a knowing stare or two from my doorman the following morning.</p>

        <p>New York is the one, but the one I never wanted. Not the one that got away, but the one I couldn’t get away from. Year after year, against my will, she pulls me back with the allure of comfort and sameness and the occasional grand gesture. We have the same friends, the same interests, the same favorite places, the same affinity for alcohol and sex. Usually together, but hopefully not always.</p>

        <p>New York makes my heart skip a beat, whether because I almost get hit by a car once a week or because the views from its many roofs have a tendency to take my breath away.</p>

        <p>Everything that New York does sounds like music to my ears. The hooves pattering on the street as the horse-drawn carriages make their way back to the barn at the end of the day. The urban youths on the sidewalk discussing topics they should not be privy to at their age. The sound of the subway arriving that people will run to catch at any cost. Even if it won’t make a difference in their day. It’s a thrill. New York sounds of beauty, but she smells like shit.</p>

        <p>New York is kind of a slut. And being a jealous person, that isn’t easy for me. It drives me insane when people claim to know her as well as I do, or get along with her more easily than I do. I put the time into this relationship, but everyone gets to reap the same benefits I do. It’s infuriating.</p>

        <p>New York and I are exhibiting all the signs of having been together too long. I used to dress myself up all nice every time I saw her; now, sweatpants will do. Sometimes I don’t even wear pants. I used to want to see and know everything about her; now, despite the fact that there is so much more to see and know, I have no desire to go down that path. I used to want to spend time with her constantly; now I yearn for alone time, far, far away from her. I once imagined our future together; now, I only imagine my future with someone else.</p>

        <p>Francois Duc de la Rochefoucauld (you think I made that up, don’t you?) said that, “Absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones, as the wind blows out the candle and blows up the bonfire.” New York and I have a great love, the bonfire kind. Every time I leave her, I yearn for her threefold. Sure, you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone. But then you get it back and it kicks you right in the ass, again.</p> 

        <p>New York, I now speak directly to you. You have built me up, and made me strong and sassy and fabulous, and I can’t tell you how much I love you for that. But you’ve also broken me down, and made me feel weak and lost and insecure. What I need right now is coddling and consistency and a sense of calm, which is something I know you can’t give me and I would never expect you to. You wouldn’t be the person I know you are if you could give me that. And that’s why I’m breaking up with you.</p>

        <p>I love her, but she can be a real bitch. Also, she took all my money.</p>

        <h1>When A Cat Is Just A Cat</h1>
        <iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0efT4YKQLQx2YHbp6vgRX8" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
        <p>Something was off; or maybe the opposite. It was too formulaic, too familiar that it had no longer become exciting or nearly as stimulating. They sat on the couch, progressively getting closer and closer till their knees were just touching, then one was on top of the other, then his arm was around her and her legs were up on the couch and her head was nestled in his armpit and his hand cupped her shoulder. The cat sat between them and for a moment there was cohesion. For a moment they felt like a family. But it was quiet. Not the peaceful kind of quiet, the uncomfortable kind that you have when two people are thinking the same thing but don't want to say it out loud.</p>

        <p>So, as it happened, they shamelessly used the guise of exhaustion to go to the bedroom, stripping down and lying down and hiding their insecurities behind a perceived comfort of having done this before.</p>

        <p>Their bodies close in the shape of a bent spoon, there was no denying it felt good and warm. Warm enough to eschew the doubt that was plaguing them because this must mean something, right? This warmth must mean there's something there to be unearthed and that would eradicate the doubt entirely. So she turned to face him and the kissing began, which also felt good and warm. And then he climbed on top of her. Finger in vagina. FingerS in vagina. She likes it. Moan. Hand on penis. Breathing into mouths. Penis IN vagina. He likes it. Back and forth. Moan. Back and forth. Moan. Repeat. Stop. Fall. BREATHE.</p>

        <p>Sleep.</p>

        <p>That felt good, and warm, but not right. Something was off. Morning slowly came and it was hard to get up, but get up they did. It got a little bit easier to get up every time.</p>

        <p>Ultimately it begged the question, why were they there? </p>

        <p>The answer was simple. Where else would they be?</p>
