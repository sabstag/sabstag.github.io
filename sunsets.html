        <h1>SUNSETS IN PARADISE</h1>
        <h2>A Parisian Romance Set In The 1920's</h2>
        <p>A few years after World War I, Alia Hart finds herself widowed and living an unsatisfactory life in Brooklyn with happiness hard to come by. Frank Horace, a surviving soldier from England, is living in Paris and struggling to find his place in the world after years of combat, anxiety, and trauma. Fate or coincidence brings Alia to Paris, where she meets Frank and in a series of surprising and unimaginable events, their lives become deeply entwined. Sunsets In Paradise is a tale of war, tragedy, and romance set in a 1920's Paris, where self-discovery and tempestuousness was the norm.</p>

      <div class="review active">"A beautifully written and deeply moving piece --an elegy for Alia as much as it is for a lost era; in this case, Paris in the 1920s. Gupta has an undoubtedly strong career ahead." <span>-Mario</span></div>
      <div class="review">"The characters are extremely well developed with depth of emotions, and they are interconnected when and in ways you least expect. Beyond just being a beautiful and mesmerizing story, it's an informed homage to a forgotten era. LOVED it!" <span>-Laura</span></div>
      <div class="review">"The characters were well developed and the story line continuously surprised me. For days after I read the last words on the page I was still transported into the world of 1920s Paris.I am so looking forward to her next piece of work." <span>-Stephanie</span></div>
      <div class="review">"This book is great. It is very entertaining, yet gut wrenching at the same time. You really feel for the characters Gupta creates." <span>-Sara</span></div>
